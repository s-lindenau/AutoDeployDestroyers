[mod-setting-description]
autodestroy_entity_to_deploy=The actual entity that gets created.
autodestroy_item_to_consume=The item that gets removed from the inventory.
autodestroy_entity_deploy_per_capsule=How many entities are spawned from 1 capsule.
autodestroy_max_accepted_wastage=Example: if the target is 6 entities, and 1 capsule spawns 5, that would be a wastage of 4 entities. The second capsule is only deployed if the wastage is not above the max accepted wastage.
autodestroy_min_capsules_remaining=How many capsules should always remain in the player's inventory. Autodeploy stops if this amount (or lower) is reached.
autodestroy_max_capsules_per_pass=How many capsules 1 launcher may throw per pass. Stacks with multiple launchers in the power armor. The default of 100 is oriented at 'unlimited', lower this for a more realistic experience.
autodestroy_aggression_factor=Configure the deploy aggression based on the player's playstyle. The default of 1.0 is oriented at bot-only warfare. Lower this value if bots are used as secondary warfare; as support to for example the flamethrower. Numbers higher than 1 can be used, however this is not advised as it will waste capsules.
autodestroy_debug_print=Prints ingame debug information for the player.
autodestroy_debug_log=Writes enemy information to a log file.
autodestroy_enemy_visibility_range=At what distance do enemies get triggered by the player and attack. This directly affects the scan distance and thus performance!
autodestroy_max_dispatch_vehicle_speed=How fast can a player in a vehicle go until automatic deployment stops? Default of 0.9 is around 200 km/h.
